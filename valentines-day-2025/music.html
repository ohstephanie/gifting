<h3>I love these songs</h3>

<ul>
    <strong><i>For Lovers</i> by Lamp</strong><br>
    <i>Because the season I like is a short thing <br>
    It melted away without me noticing <br>
    Alone in this moving scenery <br>
    I stand still and think of you</i> <br>
    <br>
    <strong><i>love.</i> by wave to earth</strong><br>
    <i>My small heart <br>
        Like small waves inside <br>
        Break and push towards you <br>
        Melting and falling away <br>
        And only then can I see my eternity</i><br>
    <br>
    <strong><i>ANGEL</i> by keshi</strong><br>
    <i>I thought you were an angel <br>
        And lost myself when I <br>
        caught sight of you<br>
        I'm bidding you farewell</i> <br>
    
    <br>
    <strong><i>blue</i> by yung kai</strong><br>
    <i>I think I'll picture us, you with the waves <br>
    The ocean's colors on your face <br>
    I'll leave my heart with your air<br>
    So let me fly with you</i><br>
    <br>
    <strong><i>우산</i> by Epik High</strong><br>
    <i>You are the umbrella above my head<br>
        On nights when the cold rain falls on my shoulders<br>
        You have become a habit next to me</i><br>
