<h3>Letters and Gifts</h3>

Expressions of love between friends, family, writing your heart on paper.
What is a stronger display of love than this?

A little note passed between cubicles during finals week,
<ul>
    A doodle,
</ul>

A surprise letter thanking me for our friendship.

<ul>
    And writing letters back, trying out expressing my heart to someone in return.
</ul>

From receiving and giving letters, is how I learned how <i>to</i> love.
