              <div class="post-content">
          <p>This is my first official weekly update to my memory site. I spend the last week catching up on all the work I pushed back all of last week. I have a lot of deadlines this week, and I have been paying the price. I had to finish my IW, but I had to do both of my COS psets first. I used 3 late days on both...</p>
<p>Last night I went off campus to watch the minecraft movie with some friends and it was really exciting. I felt like it was freshman year again, driving past the same field a little past the boathouse behind yeh. It was the evening, and we were listening to a spotify jam that we were all adding really random, unrelated songs to. It was a really eclectic group of seven -- like 3 of my circles combined. I was in bliss, and Winsice said that she had never seen me that happy before. I think it was because I was off campus.</p>
<p>I love singing in the car. I have been talking about wanting to go karaoke for so long now, and I finally got to sing my heart out in the car. It was justin bieber, and then we sang sza's SOS album which brought me back to freshman year.</p>
<p>After we came back from the movie, Brandon, Irene, Winsice and I went to Winsice's room in Dod and made Brandon try on Winsice's clothes. It was such a crazy experience -- why does he fit into the same clothes as us?</p>
<p>Nothing is that serious, and time is going by fast. We are already mid-way into April. But at the same time, there's so much that I have to think about at once. Like figuring out my thesis advisor for next year, wondering if my COS independent work project has enough COS in it, and planning the party we want to throw on the last day of class. It's cold again, my puffer jacket is tired from being worn since October. I feel like it's time to retire it, but the weather keeps teetering on the 40s and 50s.</p>
<p>When I'm with my friends, all I can think about is how fun next year is going to be. We will have so much less work on our plates, and be so near each other in spelman. I slept at 4am last night, but it was worth it.</p>        </div>
