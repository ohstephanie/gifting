  </div>


              <div class="post-content">
          <p>When I look back on this semester I just remember being in a really dark place. It was a big jump from my relatively easy freshman fall, and I was struggling to stay afloat. I also didn't have a lot of friends who were in my major, so I felt really alone in my classes, especially when it came to group assignments. The hardest class for me was COS240, which a lot of people said was chill and easy. It was <strong>NOT</strong> easy for me, since I had never done proofs or used my brain in that way before. I'm shuddering thinking about it right now.</p>
<p>But I did make two of my closest friends this semester. One of them was Grace, who I just naturally got close to so quickly. It started when we shared locations with each other. Then, before we knew it we were attached at the hip. I feel like with a lot of my best friends, there was no real origin story or journey to friendship--they just appeared in my life and we were best friends last I could remember. The other one was Winsice, who I trauma-bonded with. We took 217 and 240 together, and we met because we were in the same precept. We didn't really know each other, but we knew each other through mutual friends. She took one look at me and told me to sit next to her--then for the rest of the semester, we would sleep in precept --&gt; sleep on the couch in the CS building --&gt; sleep in our next lecture. What a time.</p>
