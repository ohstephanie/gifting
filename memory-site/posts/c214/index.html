          <p>This was the first year we became a quad. It was me, Jewel, and we hunted desperately for a 4th roommate to complete a quad because Lina's old roommate dropped last minute. We were so screwed, until someone told us about Mica who was in a similar situation. She was literally one of the ONLY girls left in yeh that could drop down to our draw group, so it worked out perfectly. We were so stressed, but it all fell in place.</p>
<p>We got such a horrible upperclassman draw time, so we <strong>needed</strong> to get a room in yeh. We drew in a group with the boys from our zee group, and they let us take 214, which was the larger of the two rooms. I just remember us screaming in the dining hall early in the morning during room draw in a huge group trying to get a room. So stressful. Glad I never have to do that again. We ended up in C214, which is where we put Hyunsung's rug. He had hid it under a couch, and it was so obviously visible peeking out from under the couch. I can't believe no one took it. We took the rug and put it in our room, for as long as we could until it got dirty. Then we had to throw it away.</p>
<p>It was a good room--honestly I can't remember it that well, but all I know is that it was really homey. We started a photo wall with all our roommate photos. We also hosted our first pregame function in that room for Jewel's surprise birthday party.</p>
